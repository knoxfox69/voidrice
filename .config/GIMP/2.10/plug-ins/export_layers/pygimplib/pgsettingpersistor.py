    """
    Load setting values from the specified list of setting sources
    (`setting_sources`) to specified list of settings or setting groups
    (`settings_or_groups`).
    
    The order of sources in the `setting_sources` list indicates the preference
    of the sources, beginning with the first source in the list. If not all
    settings could be found in the first source, the second source is read to
    assign values to the remaining settings. This continues until all settings
    are read.
    
    If settings have invalid values, their default values will be assigned.
    
    If some settings could not be found in any of the sources,
    their default values will be assigned.
    
    Parameters:
    
    * `settings_or_groups` - list of `Setting` or `SettingGroup` objects whose
      values are loaded from `setting_sources`.
    
    * `setting_sources` - list of `SettingSource` instances to read from.
    
    Returns:
    
      * `status`:
      
        * `SUCCESS` - Settings successfully loaded. This status is also returned
          if `settings_or_groups` or `setting_sources` is empty or `None`.
        
        * `NOT_ALL_SETTINGS_FOUND` - Could not find some settings from
          any of the sources. Default values are assigned to these settings.
        
        * `READ_FAIL` - Could not read data from the first source where this
          error occurred. May occur for file sources with e.g. denied read
          permission.
      
      * `status_message` - Message describing the returned status in more detail.

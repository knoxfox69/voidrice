  * adding operations to be executed before or after each operation ("for-each"
    operations),
  * adding another `OperationExecutor` instance as an operation (i.e. nesting

    """
    Add an operation to be executed by `execute()`. Return the ID of the newly
    added operation.
    
    An operation can be:
    * a function, in which case optional arguments (`args`, a list or tuple) and
      keyword arguments (`kwargs`, a dict) can be specified,
    * an `OperationExecutor` instance.
    
    To control which operations are executed, you may want to group them.
    
    If `groups` is `None` or `"default"`, the operation is added to a default
    group appropriately named `"default"`.
    
    If `groups` is a list of group names (strings), the operation is added to
    the specified groups. Groups are created automatically if they previously
    did not exist.
    
    If `groups` is `"all"`, the operation is added to all existing groups. The
    operation will not be added to the default group if it does not exist.
    
    The operation is added at the end of the list of operations in the specified
    group(s). To modify the order of the added operation, call `reorder()`.
    
    If `foreach` is `True` and the operation is a function, the operation is
    treated as a "for-each" operation. By default, a for-each operation is
    executed after each regular operation (function or `OperationExecutor`
    instance). To customize this behavior, use the `yield` statement in the
    for-each operation to specify where it is desired to execute each operation.
    For example:
    
      def foo():
        print("bar")
        yield
        print("baz")
    
    first prints `bar`, then executes the operation and finally prints `baz`.
    Multiple `yield` statements can be specified to execute the wrapped
    operation multiple times.
    
    If multiple for-each operations are added, they are executed in the order
    they were added by this method. For example:
      
      def foo1():
        print("bar1")
        yield
        print("baz1")
      
      def foo2():
        print("bar2")
        yield
        print("baz2")
    
    will print `bar1`, `bar2`, then execute the operation (only once), and then
    print `baz1` and `baz2`.
    
    To make an `OperationExecutor` instance behave as a for-each operation, wrap
    the instance in a function as shown above. For example:
      
      def execute_before_each_operation():
        executor.execute()
        yield
    
    If `ignore_if_exists` is `True`, do not add the operation if the same
    function or `OperationExecutor` instance is already added in at least one of
    the specified groups and return `None`. Note that the same function with
    different arguments is still treated as one function.
